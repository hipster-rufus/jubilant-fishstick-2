The Module 2 challenge combines all the knowledge of HTML and CSS that we have learned over the past few weeks to create a beginner's professional portfolio page.. 

# Description
By utilizing all the skills we've gained so far in both HTML and CSS, I was able to create a webpage from scratch. This webpage is a portfolio meant to be accessed by a potential employer so they can view samples of my work. 

I followed the guidelines in the acceptance criteria to create a portfolio which does the following:
* Provides my name, photo, and contact information in the header
* Stores the navigation links on the side, which scroll to the correct section when clicked
* Enlarges the first project to bring attention to it
* Provides a link to that project when clicked
* Adjusts to any viewport

While the styling has lots of room for improvement, the webpage meets all minimum criteria for an effective employee portfolio. 

# Installation

# Usage

An employer only needs to click on the link provided by me (the hypothesized potential employee) to access the portfolio page.

To browse my portfolio, click on this link: https://hipster-rufus.github.io/jubilant-fishstick-2/

The layout is very self-explanatory, and feel free to click on the links next to my name in the contacts, or the links underneath the Index to explore the page. 

The images of each project also act as links.
